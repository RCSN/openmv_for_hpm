# DMA Manager

## Overview

DMA Manager example demonstrates the following features in DMA Manager component.
- Request/release DMA resource
- Enable DMA interrupt for target DMA resource
- Install DMA callback for target DMA resource


## DMA Manager Tips

- The DMA Manager handles the interrupt inside the component, users must not declare ISR in the application

## Board Setting

No special settings

## Running the example

When the project runs correctly, and the serial port terminal will output the following information:
```console
