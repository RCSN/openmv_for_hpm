# lin_slave
## Overview

The lin_slave sample project shows that LIN sends/receives data at slave mode.

## Board Setting

Requires a LIN transceiver and USB_LIN debugger
Please refer to [Pin Description](lab_board_resource) for specific board.
connect LIN transceiver mcu signal to LIN's TX and RX on board, connect LIN transceiver LIN signal to USB_LIN debugger.

## Running the example

configure usb_lin debugger:
- configure com and baudrate, then click `Set to Debugger` option
  ![lin_debugger_configuration](../../../../../../assets/sdk/samples/lin_debugger_configuration.png)
- Configure sent data, including master sent, master receive and sync break, the sync break could wake up slave from sleep modeï¼š
  ![lin_debugger_master_sent](../../../../../../assets/sdk/samples/lin_debugger_master_sent_config.png)
- Running the example, check the result in debugger window
  ![lin_debugger_master_result](../../../../../../assets/sdk/samples/lin_debugger_master_result.png)

When the example runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:
```console

LIN bus timeout, will enter sleep mode
