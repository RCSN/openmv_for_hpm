# eRPC rtos demo

## Overview

This project executes eRPC example, uses RPMSG as transport layer protocol, uses MBX as message notification.

Core0 as the Client and Core1 as the Server.

Please refer to [official eRPC github](https://github.com/EmbeddedRPC/erpc)å’Œ[official rpmsg_lite github](https://github.com/NXPmicro/rpmsg-lite)

Currently, it is developed based on erpc v1.10.0 and rpmsg-lite v5.0.0.

## IDL file generate project files

IDL files contains all declarations used in eRPC calls. This demo IDL file as follows:
erpc_matrix_multiply.erpc:
```
/*!
 * You can write copyrights rules here. These rules will be copied into the outputs.
 */
@outputDir("erpc_outputs") // output directory
program erpc_matrix_multiply; // specify name of output files

/*! This const defines the matrix size. The value has to be the same as the
    Matrix array dimension. Do not forget to re-generate the eRPC code once the
    matrix size is changed in the eRPC file */
const int32 matrix_size = 5;

/*! This is the matrix array type. The dimension has to be the same as the
    matrix size const. Do not forget to re-generate the eRPC code once the
    matrix size is changed in the eRPC file */
type Matrix = int32[matrix_size][matrix_size];

interface MatrixMultiplyService // cover functions for same topic
{
    erpcMatrixMultiply(in Matrix matrix1, in Matrix matrix2, out Matrix result_matrix) -> void
    oneway erpcSwitchLightLed()
}
```

Please refer to `middleware/erpc/erpc/docs/IDL-Reference.md`

The easiest way for generating code is have both the tool and the IDL file in same directory (generated). Then, the following command needs be executed:
```
../../../../../middleware/erpc/erpc/tools/erpcgen/Windows/erpcgen.exe erpc_matrix_multiply.erpc
```
This action creates four files in current folder:
 - erpc_matrix_multiply.h
 - erpc_matrix_multiply_client.cpp
 - erpc_matrix_multiply_server.h
 - erpc_matrix_multiply_server.cpp

## Importing client/server files

`Client project` needs to count with __erpc_matrix_multiply.h__ and __erpc_matrix_multiply_client.cpp__ files. In the source file where the eRPC functions are called, the __erpc_matrix_multiply.h__ header file needs to be included.

`Server project` needs to count with __erpc_matrix_multiply.h__, __erpc_matrix_multiply_server.h__, and __erpc_matrix_multiply_server.cpp__ files. In source file where eRPC functions calls are implemented, the __erpc_matrix_multiply_server.h__ header file needs to be included.

## Generate core1 project
__CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE__ must be *"sec_core_img"*

## Generate core0 project
__CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE__ user can specify *"flash_sdram_xip"* or *"flash_xip"*, etc.

## Build project
__Core1__ project must be generated and built first
__Core0__ project must be generated after the core1 project has been built successfully.

## Debugging
- Download the core0 example to the target and run core0 example first
- Download the core1 example to the target and run the core1 example
- If users expects to debug the core0 and core1 example step by step, users must ensure the *board_init()* function is executed before debugging the core1 example as some hardware resoruces needs to be initialized by *board_init()* in core0 example.

## Running Results
- When the project runs successfully, The serial port terminal will output the following information:
    ```console
        Primary core started
        Starting secondary core...

        Secondary core started...

        Matrix #1
        =========
          38   13    1   10   12
          49   34   25   39   37
          16   45   17   31   32
          24   44    1    4   11
          28   35   17   15   12

        Matrix #2
        =========
          8   15   27   19   36
          17   10   43   33   16
          28   11    4   45   36

          38   43    6    3   34

        eRPC request is sent to the server

        Switch Light LED
        Press the PBUTN button to initiate the next matrix multiplication
    ```
- Press the PBUTN button to initiate the next matrix multiplication, and red led and green led will be toggle.
