# Netx Duo Tcp Client

## Overview

The netx duo tcp client example shows netx tcp client functions.

## Board Setting

No special settings are required

## Project Configuration
- By Setting `CONFIG_NETX_ENABLE_DHCP` to zero or comment the definition code in CMakeLists.txt, the DHCP will be disabled
- When DHCP is disabled, comment or delete `set(CONFIG_AZURE_RTOS_NETXDUO_ADDONS_DHCP 1)` can decrease project source files number
- In the file `CMakeLists.txt` ,  set a matched Ethernet PHY type according to the development board schematicï¼Œ

  e.g. "set(CONFIG_ENET_PHY_DP83848 1)"
- When DHCP is enabled, make sure the tcp server `SAMPLE_IPV4_ADDRESS` is reachable.

## Running the example

When the example runs successfully, it will try to connect **SAMPLE_IPV4_ADDRESS : ECHO_SERVER_PORT**(192.168.1.2:7777). Once connected, it will send message **"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ "** to the host. Then waiting for receive message from the host forever until it really receive one or server close the connection. It will print phy link status periodically until its status becomes **Up**. If received message, it will also print it to the console. If server close the connection, the receive function will return immediately. Following message is displayed in the terminal:
```console
