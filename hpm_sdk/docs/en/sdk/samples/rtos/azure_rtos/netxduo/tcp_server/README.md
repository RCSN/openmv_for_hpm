## Running the example

When the example runs successfully, it will listen to port **ECHO_SERVER_PORT**(7777). Once a client connected, it will wait for receiving message from the client with a timeout 10 seconds. It will send data received from the client back to the client and then close the connection. It will print phy link status periodically until its status becomes **Up**. Following message is displayed in the terminal:
```console
